#Save any Flash videos inside of Firefox
___
## Purpose 

Sometimes it's difficult to save flash videos when there is no custom parser  available for a particular site.

This script makes it possible to save any flash videos on a Linux box. 

It was also tested on Mac OS X but I can't garantee any success.  
___
##Usage

1. Wait for the video or videos to load using firefox.
2. Run the script by typing ./save_ff_flash.pl and make sure it is executable first.
3. This will save a copy of all the open flash videos onto your desktop.
4. Alternatively, you can specify a path where you want to save the videos using a command line argument.

___
## Requirements

Perl 5, Firefox along with the flash pluging and the lsof command installed.
